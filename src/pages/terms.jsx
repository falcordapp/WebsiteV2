          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            Welcome! Falcord is the best place to experience what your favorite
            instant messaging service looked like in the past. We're happy
            you're here.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text} style={{ marginBottom: "5px", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            (we have to include these for legal reasons! legal stuff bla bla bla, i know.)
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They
            apply to your use of our instance.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            When we say "Oldcord," "we," "us," and "our" in these terms, we mean
            the team behind Oldcord.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            When we say "instance" in these terms, we mean our hosted version of
            Oldcord.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            When we say "you" or "your," we mean you. If you're accessing our
            instance on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree
            that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and
            "you" and "your" will refer to that entity.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            We also have a Privacy Policy, Instance Guidelines, and other
            policies that apply to your use of our instance and are incorporated
            into these terms. You should read these policies—we've worked hard
            to make them simple and clear, and they contain important
            information about your use of our instance.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            Together, these rules make Falcord possible, and they matter to us.
            If you believe others aren't following them, please let us know by
            reporting it to us.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.title}>Who we are</span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            We provide an instance that allows you to interact with other
            Oldcord users (such as through direct messages) and participate in
            servers, which are digital spaces made up of different channels. Our
            instance downloads and executes older versions of your favorite
            instant messaging service directly in your browser.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.title}>
            Age Requirements and Responsibility of Parents and Legal Guardians
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            By accessing our instance, you confirm that you're at least 13 years
            old and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country.
            If you are old enough to use our instance but not old enough to have
            authority to consent to our terms, your parent or legal guardian
            must agree to our terms on your behalf. If you're a parent or legal
            guardian, and you allow your child to use the instance, then these
            terms also apply to you and you're responsible for your child's
            activity.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.title}>
            What you can expect from us
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            Falcord provides different digital spaces where you can connect with
            other users and communities. Users communicate primarily via
            "servers", which are digital spaces made up of different channels.
            Text channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as
            well as images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media. Voice
            channels allow users to communicate by voice.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            Users create servers, and users choose which servers to join. All
            users must follow our Instance Guidelines and other policies, but in
            servers, the server owners and server admins control the server
            permissions and additional rules, including establishing membership
            requirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do
            within the server.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.title}>Your Falcord account</span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            To access the instance, you will need to create an Falcord account.
            You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you
            (such as an email address).
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree
            to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been
            compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we
            (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your
            Oldcord account.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            You must always provide accurate information to Falcord and maintain
            the accuracy of the information associated with your account. We may
            assume that any communications we've received from your account or
            the associated contact information have been made by you.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            If you get locked out of your account, we'll need to contact you at
            the email associated with your account. If your account is
            compromised or you no longer have access to your email account, we
            may not be able to restore your access to your account.

          <span className={sectionStyles.subtitle}>Your Content</span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            When we say "your content", we mean all the things you add (upload,
            post, share, etc.) to our instance. You don't have any obligation to
            add content to the instance. If you choose to add content to the
            instance, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right
            to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this
            section of these terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no
            responsibility for your content, and we are not responsible for
            others' use of your content.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text} style={{ marginBottom: "0" }}>
            Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use
            Falcord. Your content may be protected by certain intellectual
            property rights. We don't own those. But by using our instance, you
            grant us a license—which is a form of permission—to do the following

            <li className={sectionStyles.text}>
              Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if

          </ul>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still
            license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are
            no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete

          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            We welcome feedback on our instance. By sending us feedback, you
            grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable
            license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback
            without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.

          <span className={sectionStyles.subtitle}>Other content</span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            Our instance might also provide you with access to other people's
            content. You may not use this content without that person's consent,

            necessarily reflect Falcord's own views. We don't endorse or verify

            </li>
            <li className={sectionStyles.text}>
              Don't use the instance to do harm to Falcord. Among other things,

              viruses or other malicious code to our instance, abusing or

              Don't use the instance to do anything else that's illegal. This

            Welcome to Falcord! We created Falcord to be a safe and enjoyable
            environment where everyone can express themselves and find community

            These Guidelines explain what isn't allowed on Falcord. Everyone on
            Falcord must follow these rules, and they apply to all parts of our
            Instance, including your content, behaviors, and interactions.
            Please note that this only applies to our Instance; third-party
            instances might have different guidelines.

          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>
            When we discover a violation of these Guidelines, we will take
            appropriate enforcement steps, including issuing warnings, removing
            content, or suspending/removing violative accounts.
          </span>
          <span className={sectionStyles.text}>

              other users.

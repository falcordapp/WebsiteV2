              He's like Henry the Hoover's long-lost cousin who fell into a vat
              of hurple dye (that's hue shifted blurple for you newcomers)
            </li>
            <li className={styles.text}>
              He's so powerful, he once accidentally vacuumed up three #general
              channels and a moderator

            <li className={styles.text}>
              Some say he's been cleaning up 404 errors since before Discord had
              dark theme (spooky!)

              He's totally not associated with that{" "}

            Why not help Hurple tidy up? Legend has it that if you press

            Remember: Every 404 error is just an opportunity for Hurple to show
            off his mad vacuum skills! Unlike some{" "}
            <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>other</span> cleaning

            Tips: If you see any dust bunnies hiding in the client files, don't
            worry - Hurple's got your back! He's basically like a vacuum-powered
            antivirus, but for nostalgia.
